# Steps to run in Unity:

- Clone this repository into your local machine
- Download Vuforia 10.13.3 form this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vQv2lROjabolbFA9b-p_a9s83z4G-me3/view?usp=sharing)
- Do not extract the downloaded tgz file. Simply move it inside the **Packages** folder
- Install Unity Hub & Unity 2021, preferably 2021.3.18f1 to avoid risk of breaking changes. Make sure to include Android and iOS as supported build platforms when installing the Unity Editor
- Open Unity Hub and click on the arrow next to the **Open** button, then click on **Add Project From Disk**
- Choose the project's root folder
- Once the project is open, go to **File > Build Settings**, and on the left, choose **Android or iOS** depending on your needs
- Click on the **Switch Platform** button on the bottom right if it's there instead of the **Build** button
- Congratulations, you can now build the application or run it in the Unity Editor. The main two scenes can be found in **Assets > Scenes > Main**. Use the **Game View** accessible from **Window > General > Game** to view the application in **16:9 Portraint** or switch from 'Game' to 'Simulator' and choose a device screen resolution.
